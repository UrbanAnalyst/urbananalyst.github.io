                Urban transport will change rapidly across the world in the
                coming years, yet access to good walking and cycling paths, and
                to public transport, are not equally distributed throughout most
                cities.  Urban Transport Analyst is a tool to assess the social
                equity of transport infrastructure. The effects of any proposed
                changes to transport infrastructure can be assessed in terms of
                their social equitability, both as aggregated across entire
                cities, and in fine-scaled local detail.<br><br>
