                Access to good walking and cycling paths, and to public
                transport, are not equally distributed throughout most cities.
                These unequal distributions are often related to other measures
                of social inequality.  Urban Transport Analyst (UTA) is a tool
                to assess the social equity of transport infrastructure. The
                effects of any proposed changes to transport infrastructure can
                be assessed in terms of their social equitability, both as
                aggregated across entire cities, and in fine-scaled local
                detail.<br><br>
