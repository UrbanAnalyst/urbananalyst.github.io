                Urban transport will change rapidly across the world in the
                coming years, especially by encouraging and enabling active
                movement (such as walking and cycling), and the use of public
                transport.  Access to good walking and cycling paths, and to
                public transport, are however not equally distributed throughout
                most cities.  Urban Transport Analyst is a tool to assess the
                social equity of transport infrastructure. This tool will enable
                the effects of any proposed changes to transport infrastructure
                to be assessed in terms of their social equitability, both as
                aggregated across entire cities, and in fine-scaled local
                detail.<br><br>

                Development is scheduled to begin in September 2022.
