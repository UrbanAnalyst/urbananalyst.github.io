This site collects no information whatsoever.  You can't log in; there are no
analytics; there is no way the site itself can or will track who looks at what,
how often, or how many.  Well, okay, "you can't log in" is not quite true -
commenting requires logging in. To github. And that only so that the magic of
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://utteranc.es">
    utterance.es</a> can post comments directly as part of github issues on the
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                   href="https://github.com/mpadge/mpadge.github.io/issues">
    github site of this blog</a>. Nothing is done with those data, and your
identity is not used in any way other than to enable you to comment on github.
There are no cookies, nor are any loaded by any other libraries used to serve
this site. The only external calls are made to load fonts, all delivered via

thanks for asking).  And of course with no way of telling who might have visited
the site, there are also no advertisements, nor will there
ever be, so you'll be safe there too.
